# XAF - How to dynamically change mask settings based on the current object

This example demonstrates how to change mask settings of aÂ certainÂ editorÂ dynamicallyÂ (for example, based onÂ properties of the current object).
  
<kbd>![example](./CS/EFCore/DynamicMaskEF/DynamicMaskEF.Module/Images/how-to-dynamically-change-mask-settings.gif)</kbd>

## Implementation Details

There are two ways to implement this functionality:

1. Implement a `ViewController` that handles events of the current view and changes settings of required editors, as shown in the following topic: [Access the Settings of a Property Editor in a Detail View](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/402153/getting-started/in-depth-tutorial-blazor/customize-data-display-and-view-layout/access-editor-settings).
2. Implement a custom Property Editor (for example, a descendant of the correspondingÂ built-in property editor) and changeÂ settings of the associated underlying control. For more information, refer to the following helpÂ section: [Property Editors](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113097/ui-construction/view-items-and-property-editors/property-editors?p=netframework).

This example demonstrates the first approach. To implement it, the following classes are added:

* `DemoObject` - a persistent class with `TestString` and `Mask` properties. Mask settings of the `TestString` property are changed based on the value of the `Mask` property.
* `ChangeMaskControllerBase` - a platform-independent controllerÂ that handles events required to update the mask settings at the appropriate time.
* `WinChangeMaskController` - a WinForms-specific controller that customizes settings of a WinForms control.
* `BlazorChangeMaskController` -Â aÂ Blazor-specific controller that customizes settings of a Blazor control.

Note thatÂ theseÂ approaches can be used only for detail views. To implement the same functionality in a ListView,Â create a ViewController forÂ it andÂ customize its List Editor according to specifics of the List Editor's control (seeÂ [How to: Access the Grid Component in a List View](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/402154/ui-construction/list-editors/how-to-access-list-editor-control)).Â For example, in WinForms you can use the `GridView.CustomColumnDisplayText` event to pass the required text directly to a grid cell. You can also use the `GridView.CustomRowCellEdit` event to supply editors with different settings for different rows.
